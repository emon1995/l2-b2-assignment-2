# Live Project Link:

1. Set up your project:
   Create a Project Directory: Create a directory for your project.
   Initialize a Node.js Project: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
2. Install Dependencies:
   Install the required dependencies for your project using npm. For a Node.js Express app with MongoDB, you'll need Express and the MongoDB driver (Mongoose or MongoDB native driver).

npm install express mongoose

3. Create Your Express App:
   Write Your Code: Create your Node.js files (index.js, app.js, or any other filename you prefer) and write your Express app logic. This will include setting up routes, handling requests, connecting to the database, etc.
   Set Up MongoDB Connection: Ensure your Express app connects to your locally installed MongoDB. Use a connection string (mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabase) to connect your app to the local MongoDB instance.
4. Start Your Application:
   Run the Server: Start your Express app by running the main file (e.g., node index.js or node app.js) in your terminal.
   Check the Console: Look for any errors or messages printed in the console. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message indicating that your server is running.
5. Access Your Application:
   Once your server is running, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your app) to access your application.
   Test your routes and endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
